I’m on macOS and this VS Code workspace includes my Boomi local Atom runtime directories:

- Execution directory: /opt/Boomi/atom/jmxDemo/execution
- Component directory: /opt/Boomi/atom/jmxDemo/component

Goal:
Find which Boomi *parent processes* (process components) are consuming the most disk space in execution logs, so I can tune logging and/or process design.

What to do:
1) Scan the execution directory and compute disk usage by execution:
   - Treat each execution as a folder (or identifiable execution unit).
   - Sum the sizes of all files under that execution recursively.
   - Do NOT read log file contents; use filesystem metadata only (fast, memory-safe).

2) Correlate each execution to its parent process/component:
   - Parse execution metadata files within each execution folder (JSON/XML/properties) to extract a process/component identifier (processId/componentId/name).
   - If only an ID is available, resolve it by parsing the Boomi component XML files under /opt/Boomi/atom/jmxDemo/component.
   - Prefer XML parsing over brittle string matching.

3) Aggregate and summarize:
   - Group by parent process (process name + id if available).
   - Compute: execution count, total log size, average size, max size.
   - Output “Top N” (default 20) sorted by total log size descending.

Output requirements:
- Print a concise summary table to the terminal:
  Parent Process | Process ID (if found) | Exec Count | Total Size (MB) | Avg Size (MB) | Max Size (MB)
- Also write a CSV report file (e.g., boomi_log_space_report.csv) in the workspace root.

Implementation requirements:
- Generate a working script in Python 3 (best cross-platform option on macOS).
- Provide clear configuration variables at the top for the two paths and “Top N”.
- Handle missing/unknown correlations gracefully (bucket as “UNKNOWN_PROCESS”).
- Be read-only (non-destructive).
- Add brief comments so I can extend it later.

Deliverables:
- The complete Python script ready to run.
- A short note showing the exact command to run it from the VS Code terminal.
- print two rankings: (1) Top by total size, (2) Top by average execution size.
