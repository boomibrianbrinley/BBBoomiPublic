I’m on Windows and this VS Code workspace includes my Boomi local Atom runtime directories:

- Execution directory: C:\Boomi\atom\<ATOM_NAME>\execution
- Component directory: C:\Boomi\atom\<ATOM_NAME>\component

Goal:
Find which Boomi parent processes (process components) consume the most disk space in execution logs so I can tune logging and/or process design.

What to do:
1) Scan the execution directory and compute disk usage by execution:
   - Treat each execution as a folder (or identifiable execution unit).
   - Sum sizes of all files under each execution folder recursively.
   - Do NOT read log file contents; use filesystem metadata only (fast and safe).

2) Correlate each execution to its parent process/component:
   - Parse execution metadata files inside each execution folder (XML/JSON/properties) to extract a process/component identifier (processId/componentId/name).
   - If only an ID is available, resolve it by parsing Boomi component XML files under the component directory.
   - Prefer structured parsing (XML parser) over brittle string matching where possible.
   - If correlation can’t be determined, bucket as UNKNOWN_PROCESS.

3) Aggregate and summarize:
   - Group by parent process (process name + id if available).
   - Compute: execution count, total size, average size, max size.
   - Output Top N (default 20) sorted by total size desc.

Output requirements:
- Print a concise summary table to the terminal:
  Parent Process | Process ID (if found) | Exec Count | Total Size (MB) | Avg Size (MB) | Max Size (MB)
- Write a CSV report in the workspace root: boomi_log_space_report.csv

Implementation requirements:
- Generate a working PowerShell script (PowerShell 7+ preferred, but compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1 if feasible).
- Put configuration variables at the top: $ExecutionDir, $ComponentDir, $TopN, $OutCsv
- Be read-only (non-destructive).
- Handle large folder counts efficiently (avoid loading entire file lists into memory if possible).
- Add short comments so I can adjust patterns and paths later.

Deliverables:
- The complete .ps1 script ready to run.
- A short note showing the exact command to run it in VS Code terminal.
